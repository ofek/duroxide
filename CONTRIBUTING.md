When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (for example, label or comment).
Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once
across all repositories using our CLA.

## Reporting security issues

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Follow the instructions in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Development workflow

- Write or update tests first for behavior changes.
- Keep public APIs stable where possible; note breakages clearly.
- Prefer small, focused commits with descriptive messages.
- For non-trivial changes, include a short design rationale in the pull request description with code pointers.
- Update documentation when a change affects existing docs, introduces a new surface area, or changes behavior users rely on.

Before opening a pull request, run the checks relevant to your change:

```bash
cargo nt
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
cargo test --doc
```

For broader runtime changes, also run the comprehensive two-pass suite:

```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

## Filing pull requests

Use the pull request template in [.github/pull_request_template.md](.github/pull_request_template.md) and fill in the docs checkboxes.
