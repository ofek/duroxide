/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// - The provider must ensure `history` contains ALL events for `execution_id` in order
/// - For multi-execution instances (ContinueAsNew), only return the LATEST execution's history
/// - The `lock_token` must be unique and prevent concurrent processing of the same instance
/// - All messages in the batch should belong to the same instance
/// - The lock should expire after a timeout (e.g., 30s) to handle worker crashes
/// - If history deserialization fails, set `history_error` with the error message and return

///   and terminate the orchestration after `max_attempts`.

/// # ContinueAsNew Handling

/// ContinueAsNew is handled entirely by the runtime. Providers must NOT try to

/// - When an orchestration calls `continue_as_new(input)`, the runtime stamps

/// - Use the explicit `execution_id` given to `ack_orchestration_item`.

/// # Design Principles
///
/// **Providers should be storage abstractions, NOT orchestration engines:**
/// - ✅ Store and retrieve events as opaque data (don't inspect Event contents)
/// - ✅ Manage queues and locks (generic queue operations)
/// - ✅ Provide ACID guarantees where possible
/// - ❌ DON'T interpret orchestration semantics (use ExecutionMetadata from runtime)
/// - ❌ DON'T create events (runtime creates all events)
/// - ❌ DON'T make orchestration decisions (runtime decides control flow)
///
/// # Multi-Execution Support (ContinueAsNew)
///
/// Orchestration instances can have multiple executions (execution_id 1, 2, 3, ...):
/// - Each execution has its own event history
/// - `read()` should return the LATEST execution's history
/// - Provider tracks current_execution_id to know which execution is active
/// - When metadata.create_next_execution=true, create a new execution record/entry
///
/// **Example:**
/// ```text
/// Instance "order-123":
///   Execution 1: [OrchestrationStarted, ActivityScheduled, OrchestrationContinuedAsNew]
///   Execution 2: [OrchestrationStarted, ActivityScheduled, OrchestrationCompleted]
///   
///   read("order-123") → Returns Execution 2's events (latest)
///   read_with_execution("order-123", 1) → Returns Execution 1's events
///   latest_execution_id("order-123") → Returns Some(2)
/// ```
///
/// # Concurrency Model
///
/// The runtime runs 3 background dispatchers polling your queues:
/// 1. **Orchestration Dispatcher**: Polls fetch_orchestration_item() continuously
/// 2. **Work Dispatcher**: Polls fetch_work_item() continuously
/// 3. **Timer Dispatcher**: Polls dequeue_timer_peek_lock() continuously
///
/// **Your implementation must be thread-safe** and support concurrent access from multiple dispatchers.
///
/// # Peek-Lock Pattern (Critical)
///
/// All dequeue operations use peek-lock semantics:
/// 1. **Peek**: Select and lock a message (message stays in queue)
/// 2. **Process**: Runtime processes the locked message
/// 3. **Ack**: Delete message from queue (success) OR
/// 4. **Abandon**: Release lock for retry (failure)
///
/// Benefits:
/// - At-least-once delivery (messages survive crashes)
/// - Automatic retry on worker failure (lock expires)
/// - Prevents duplicate processing (locked messages invisible to others)
///
/// # Transactional Guarantees
///
/// **`ack_orchestration_item()` is the atomic boundary:**
/// - ALL operations in ack must succeed or fail together
/// - History append + queue enqueues + lock release = atomic
/// - If commit fails, entire turn is retried
/// - This ensures exactly-once semantics for orchestration turns
///
/// # Queue Message Flow
///
/// **Orchestrator Queue:**
/// - Inputs: StartOrchestration, ActivityCompleted/Failed, TimerFired, ExternalRaised, SubOrchCompleted/Failed, CancelInstance, ContinueAsNew
/// - Output: Processed by orchestration dispatcher → ack_orchestration_item
/// - Batching: All messages for an instance processed together
/// - Timers: TimerFired items are enqueued with `visible_at = fire_at_ms` for delayed visibility
///
/// **Worker Queue:**
/// - Inputs: ActivityExecute (from ack_orchestration_item)
/// - Output: Processed by work dispatcher → ActivityCompleted/Failed to orch queue
/// - Batching: One message at a time (activities executed independently)
///
/// **Note:** There is no separate timer queue. Timers are handled by enqueuing TimerFired items
/// directly to the orchestrator queue with delayed visibility (`visible_at` set to `fire_at_ms`).
/// The orchestrator dispatcher processes them when `visible_at <= now()`.
///
/// # Instance Metadata Management
///
/// Providers typically maintain metadata about instances:
/// - instance_id (primary key)
/// - orchestration_name, orchestration_version
/// - current_execution_id (for multi-execution support)
/// - status, output (optional, for quick queries)
/// - created_at, updated_at timestamps
///
/// This metadata is updated via:
/// - `enqueue_for_orchestrator()` with StartOrchestration
/// - `ack_orchestration_item()` with history changes
/// - `ExecutionMetadata` for status/output updates
///
/// # Required vs Optional Methods
///
/// **REQUIRED** (must implement):
/// - fetch_orchestration_item, ack_orchestration_item, abandon_orchestration_item
/// - read, append_with_execution
/// - enqueue_for_worker, fetch_work_item, ack_work_item
/// - enqueue_for_orchestrator
///
/// **OPTIONAL** (has defaults):
/// - latest_execution_id, read_with_execution
/// - list_instances, list_executions
///
/// # Recommended Database Schema (SQL Example)

///
/// # Implementing a New Provider: Checklist
///
/// 1. ✅ **Storage Layer**: Choose backing store (PostgreSQL, Redis, DynamoDB, etc.)
/// 2. ✅ **Serialization**: Use serde_json for Event and WorkItem (or compatible format)
/// 3. ✅ **Instance Locking**: Implement instance-level locks to prevent concurrent processing
/// 4. ✅ **Locking**: Implement peek-lock with unique tokens and expiration
/// 5. ✅ **Transactions**: Ensure `ack_orchestration_item` is atomic
/// 6. ✅ **Indexes**: Add indexes on `instance_id`, `lock_token`, `visible_at` for orchestrator queue
/// 7. ✅ **Delayed Visibility**: Support `visible_at` timestamps for TimerFired items in orchestrator queue
/// 8. ✅ **Testing**: Use `tests/sqlite_provider_validations.rs` as a template, or see `docs/provider-implementation-guide.md`
/// 9. ✅ **Multi-execution**: Support execution_id partitioning for ContinueAsNew
/// 10. ⚠️ **DO NOT**: Inspect event contents (use ExecutionMetadata)
/// 11. ⚠️ **DO NOT**: Create events (runtime owns event creation)
/// 12. ⚠️ **DO NOT**: Make orchestration decisions (runtime owns logic)

/// Core provider trait for runtime orchestration operations.
///
/// This trait defines the essential methods required for durable orchestration execution.
/// It focuses on runtime-critical operations: fetching work items, processing history,
/// and managing queues. Management and observability features are provided through
/// optional capability traits.
///
/// # Capability Discovery
///
/// Providers can implement additional capability traits (like `ProviderAdmin`)
/// to expose richer features. The `Client` automatically discovers these capabilities
/// through the `as_management_capability()` method.
///
/// # Implementation Guide for LLMs
///
/// When implementing a new provider, focus on these core methods:
///
/// ## Required Methods (9 total)
///
/// 1. **Orchestration Processing (3 methods)**
///    - `fetch_orchestration_item()` - Atomic batch processing
///    - `ack_orchestration_item()` - Commit processing results
///    - `abandon_orchestration_item()` - Release locks and retry
///
/// 2. **History Access (1 method)**
///    - `read()` - Get event history for status checks
///
/// 3. **Worker Queue (2 methods)**
///    - `fetch_work_item()` - Get activity work items
///    - `ack_work_item()` - Acknowledge activity completion
///
/// 4. **Orchestrator Queue (1 method)**
///    - `enqueue_for_orchestrator()` - Enqueue control messages (including TimerFired with delayed visibility)
///
/// ## Optional Management Methods (2 methods)
///
/// These are included for backward compatibility but will be moved to
/// `ProviderAdmin` in future versions:
///
/// - `list_instances()` - List all instance IDs
/// - `list_executions()` - List execution IDs for an instance
///
/// # Capability Detection
///
/// Implement `as_management_capability()` to expose management features:
///
/// ```ignore
/// impl Provider for MyProvider {
///     // ... implement required methods
///     
///     fn as_management_capability(&self) -> Option<&dyn ProviderAdmin> {
///         Some(self as &dyn ProviderAdmin)
///     }
/// }
///
/// impl ProviderAdmin for MyProvider {
///     // ... implement management methods
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Testing Your Provider
///
/// See `tests/sqlite_provider_validations.rs` for comprehensive provider validation tests:
/// - Basic enqueue/dequeue operations
/// - Transactional atomicity
/// - Instance locking correctness (including multi-threaded tests)
/// - Lock expiration and redelivery
/// - Multi-execution support
/// - Execution status and output persistence
///

    // ===== Core Atomic Orchestration Methods (REQUIRED) =====
    // These three methods form the heart of reliable orchestration execution.
    //
    // ⚠️ CRITICAL ID GENERATION CONTRACT:
    //
    // The provider MUST NOT generate execution_id or event_id values.
    // All IDs are generated by the runtime and passed to the provider:
    //   - execution_id: Passed to ack_orchestration_item()
    //   - event_id: Set in each Event in the history_delta
    //
    // The provider's role is to STORE these IDs, not generate them.

    /// Fetch the next orchestration work item atomically.
    ///
    /// # What This Does
    ///
    /// 1. **Select an instance to process**: Find the next available message in orchestrator queue that is not locked
    /// 2. **Acquire instance-level lock**: Atomically claim the instance lock to prevent concurrent processing
    /// 3. **Lock ALL messages** for that instance (batch processing)
    /// 4. **Load history**: Get complete event history for the current execution
    /// 5. **Load metadata**: Get orchestration_name, version, execution_id
    /// 6. **Return locked batch**: Provider must prevent other processes from touching this instance
    ///
    /// # ⚠️ CRITICAL: Instance-Level Locking
    ///
    /// **You MUST acquire an instance-level lock BEFORE fetching messages.** This prevents concurrent
    /// dispatchers from processing the same instance simultaneously, which would cause race conditions
    /// and data corruption.
    ///
    /// **Required Implementation Pattern:**
    /// 1. Find available instance (check no other lock is held for it)
    /// 2. Atomically acquire instance lock (with conflict handling)
    /// 3. Verify lock acquisition succeeded
    /// 4. Only then proceed to lock and fetch messages
    ///
    /// See `docs/provider-implementation-guide.md` for detailed implementation guidance.
    ///
    /// # Peek-Lock Semantics
    ///
    /// - Messages remain in queue until `ack_orchestration_item()` is called
    /// - Generate a unique `lock_token` (e.g., UUID)
    /// - Set `locked_until` timestamp (e.g., now + 30 seconds)
    /// - If lock expires before ack, messages become available again (automatic retry)
    ///
    /// # Visibility Filtering
    ///
    /// Only return messages where `visible_at <= now()`:
    /// - Normal messages: visible immediately
    /// - Delayed messages: `visible_at = now + delay` (used for timer backpressure)
    ///
    /// # Instance Batching
    ///
    /// **CRITICAL:** All messages in the batch must belong to the SAME instance.
    ///
    /// Implementation steps:
    /// 1. Find the first visible, unlocked instance in the orchestrator queue
    /// 2. Atomically acquire the instance lock (prevent concurrent processing)
    /// 3. Lock ALL queued messages for that instance
    /// 4. Fetch all locked messages for processing
    ///
    /// # History Loading
    ///
    /// - For new instances (no history yet): return empty Vec
    /// - For existing instances: return ALL events for current execution_id, ordered by event_id
    /// - For multi-execution instances: return ONLY the LATEST execution's history
    ///
    /// SQLite example:
    /// ```text
    /// // Get current execution ID
    /// let exec_id = SELECT current_execution_id FROM instances WHERE instance_id = ?
    ///
    /// // Load history for that execution
    /// SELECT event_data FROM history
    /// WHERE instance_id = ? AND execution_id = ?
    /// ORDER BY event_id

    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// - `lock_timeout`: Duration to lock the item for processing.
    /// - `poll_timeout`: Maximum time to wait for work. Provider MAY wait up to this
    ///   duration if it supports long polling, or return immediately if it doesn't.
    /// - `session`: Session routing configuration.
    ///   - `Some(config)`: Session-aware fetch — returns non-session + owned + claimable session items.
