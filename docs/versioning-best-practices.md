## Code Organization Pattern

Keep the orchestration NAME constant stable across all versions. Create separate functions for each version with a version suffix:

```rust
// names.rs - Keep NAME constant stable
pub const MY_ORCHESTRATION: &str = "my-app::orchestration::my-orch";

// my_orchestration.rs
use duroxide::OrchestrationContext;

/// Version 1.0.0 - Original implementation
pub async fn my_orchestration(
    ctx: OrchestrationContext, 
    input: String
) -> Result<String, String> {
    ctx.trace_info("Starting...");
    // Original logic
    ctx.schedule_timer(Duration::from_secs(60)).await;
    ctx.continue_as_new(input).await
}

/// Version 1.0.1 - Added version prefix to traces for debugging
pub async fn my_orchestration_1_0_1(
    ctx: OrchestrationContext, 
    input: String
) -> Result<String, String> {
    ctx.trace_info("[v1.0.1] Starting...");
    // Same logic with improved observability
    ctx.schedule_timer(Duration::from_secs(60)).await;
    ctx.continue_as_new(input).await
}

/// Version 1.0.2 - Increased timer interval
pub async fn my_orchestration_1_0_2(
    ctx: OrchestrationContext, 
    input: String
) -> Result<String, String> {
    ctx.trace_info("[v1.0.2] Starting...");
    // Updated logic with longer interval
    ctx.schedule_timer(Duration::from_secs(300)).await;
    ctx.continue_as_new(input).await
}
```

**Why this pattern works:**
- The NAME constant provides stable identity for the orchestration
- Separate functions allow different implementations without breaking replay
- Version suffixes make code navigation easy (`my_orch_1_0_1`, `my_orch_1_0_2`)
- Trace prefixes like `[v1.0.2]` make log analysis straightforward

---

## Registration Pattern

Register all versions in your registry, with the default version using `register_typed` and explicit versions using `register_versioned_typed`:

```rust
use crate::orchestrations::{
    MY_ORCHESTRATION,
    my_orchestration,
    my_orchestration_1_0_1, 
    my_orchestration_1_0_2,
};

let orchestrations = OrchestrationRegistry::builder()
    // Default version (1.0.0) - use register_typed
    .register_typed(MY_ORCHESTRATION, my_orchestration)
    
    // Explicit versions - use register_versioned_typed
    .register_versioned_typed(MY_ORCHESTRATION, "1.0.1", my_orchestration_1_0_1)
    .register_versioned_typed(MY_ORCHESTRATION, "1.0.2", my_orchestration_1_0_2)
    
    .build();
```

**Key points:**
- `register_typed()` registers at version `1.0.0` by default
- `register_versioned_typed()` registers at the specified semver version
- The default version policy is `Latest` - new starts and `continue_as_new` use the highest version
- Use `set_version_policy()` to pin new instances to a specific version if needed

---

## Version Upgrade Timing

**Critical concept:** Version upgrades happen at `continue_as_new` time, NOT when the server restarts.

This explains why you might see a delay between deploying a new version and seeing it reflected in your UI/monitoring:

```
Timeline example:

T+0:00  Server restarts with v1.0.2 registered
        But v1.0.1 was mid-cycle with ~1 min left on its timer
        
T+1:00  v1.0.1's timer expires, orchestration does its work
        
T+1:01  v1.0.1 calls continue_as_new()
        → Duroxide resolves "Latest" policy → v1.0.2
        → Database updated: orchestration_version = "1.0.2"
        → New execution starts with v1.0.2 code
        
T+1:02  UI/API refreshes → now shows v1.0.2
```

**Why this matters:**
- Duroxide doesn't interrupt running orchestrations
- The version policy (`Latest`) is evaluated when a new execution starts
- If you have a long timer (e.g., 5 minutes), the old version runs until that timer expires
- This is intentional - it ensures orchestration determinism and clean execution boundaries

## Best Practices Checklist

### ✅ DO

1. **Keep NAME constants stable** across all versions
   ```rust
   pub const MY_ORCH: &str = "myapp::orchestration::my-orch"; // Never changes
   ```

2. **Use version suffix on function names**
   ```rust
   my_orch()       // v1.0.0
   my_orch_1_0_1() // v1.0.1
   my_orch_1_0_2() // v1.0.2
   ```

3. **Add version prefix to trace logs** for easier debugging
   ```rust
   ctx.trace_info("[v1.0.2] Starting health check cycle");
   ctx.trace_info("[v1.0.2] Completed iteration, continuing...");
   ```

4. **Document version changes** in code comments
   ```rust
   /// Version 1.0.2 - Changes from 1.0.1:
   /// - Increased timer interval from 2 min to 5 min
   /// - Added retry logic for health checks
   ```

5. **Test version transitions** in development before rollout
   - Deploy new version
   - Verify old version completes its cycle
   - Verify new version starts after `continue_as_new`

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Don't change the NAME constant** when creating new versions
2. **Don't expect immediate version switch** after server restart
3. **Don't use `continue_as_new_versioned()`** unless you specifically need to pin to a version
4. **Don't delete old version code** until all instances have upgraded

## Version Info Flow

Understanding how version information flows through the system:

```

│      { "version": "1.0.2", ... }                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Your UI / Dashboard                             │
│  └── Displays: "Version: 1.0.2"                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

To display version in your UI:
1. Call `client.get_instance_info(instance_id)` 
2. Access `info.orchestration_version`
3. Include in your API response
4. Display in your dashboard

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Hot-fix deployment

You need to deploy a critical fix to a long-running orchestration:

```rust
// v1.0.1 - Critical fix for health check timeout
pub async fn health_monitor_1_0_1(ctx: OrchestrationContext, input: String) -> Result<String, String> {
    ctx.trace_info("[v1.0.1] Starting with increased timeout fix");
    
    // Fixed: Increased timeout from 5s to 30s
    let result = ctx.schedule_activity_with_retry(
        "HealthCheck",
        input.clone(),
        RetryPolicy::new(3).with_timeout(Duration::from_secs(30)),
    ).await?;
    
    ctx.schedule_timer(Duration::from_secs(60)).await;
    ctx.continue_as_new(input).await
}
```

**What happens:**
1. Deploy server with v1.0.1 registered
2. Running v1.0.0 instances complete their current timer
3. On `continue_as_new`, they automatically upgrade to v1.0.1
4. New fix takes effect without manual intervention

### Scenario 2: Graceful migration with state changes

If you need to transform state between versions:

```rust
// v2.0.0 - New state format
pub async fn my_orch_2_0_0(ctx: OrchestrationContext, input: String) -> Result<String, String> {
    ctx.trace_info("[v2.0.0] Starting with new state format");
    
    // Handle migration from v1 state format
    let state: MyState = if input.starts_with("{\"v1\":") {
        ctx.trace_info("[v2.0.0] Migrating from v1 state format");
        migrate_v1_to_v2(&input)?
    } else {
        serde_json::from_str(&input)?
    };
    
    // Continue with v2 logic...
    ctx.continue_as_new(serde_json::to_string(&state)?).await
}
```

### Scenario 3: Pinning to exact version

If you need to prevent automatic upgrades (e.g., during testing):

```rust
let orchestrations = OrchestrationRegistry::builder()
    .register_typed(MY_ORCH, my_orchestration)
    .register_versioned_typed(MY_ORCH, "1.0.1", my_orchestration_1_0_1)
    .set_policy(MY_ORCH, VersionPolicy::Exact(Version::parse("1.0.0").unwrap()))
    .build();
```

Or use `continue_as_new_versioned` for explicit control:

```rust
// Stay on current version explicitly
ctx.continue_as_new_versioned("1.0.0", input).await
```

---

## Draining Stuck Orchestrations (Version Mismatch)

After a major upgrade, some orchestrations may be pinned to an old duroxide version that no
running node supports. These items sit in the queue indefinitely because the capability filter
excludes them.

To clear them, temporarily widen `supported_replay_versions` on one or more nodes:

```rust
let runtime = Runtime::builder()
    .with_provider(provider)
    .with_options(RuntimeOptions {
        // Widen range to include all possible pinned versions
        supported_replay_versions: Some(SemverRange::new(
            semver::Version::new(0, 0, 0),
            semver::Version::new(99, 0, 0),
        )),
        max_attempts: 5,
        ..Default::default()
    })
    .build()
    .await?;
```

**What happens:**
1. The wide range causes the provider filter to pass for all items, regardless of pinned version.
2. The provider fetches the item and attempts to deserialize its history. If the history
   contains unknown event types (from a newer duroxide version), deserialization fails at the
   provider level with a permanent error. The item never reaches the runtime's replay engine.
3. Each fetch cycle increments the item's `attempt_count`. The item remains in the queue with
   repeated permanent errors, effectively preventing it from being processed.
4. Items whose history deserializes successfully are processed normally by the replay engine.

**After draining:** Revert `supported_replay_versions` to `None` (the default) or the
appropriate range for your cluster.

> **Note:** This approach is safe because items with truly incompatible history fail at
> provider-level deserialization — they never reach the replay engine and are never silently
> replayed with incorrect semantics. The items remain in the queue with escalating
> `attempt_count` but are functionally drained (permanently erroring on every fetch).

> **Current limitation:** The drain mechanism relies entirely on serde deserialization
> failures for unknown `EventKind` variants. There is no runtime-level replay engine version
> check — the `supported_replay_versions` range controls only which items are fetched, not
> whether the replay engine can actually process them. If a future version introduces
> semantic changes without adding new event types (i.e., history still deserializes but
> replay behavior differs), the wide-range approach would not catch this. A built-in
> replay-engine compatibility check may be added in a future phase.

### Rolling Upgrades with Session Activities

Session-bound activities are pinned to the owning worker until the session unpins.
During rolling upgrades, ensure session activity handlers are registered on all workers
before orchestrations schedule activities on sessions. If a session activity is not
registered on the owning worker, it will poison after `max_attempts` backoff cycles
rather than failing over to an upgraded worker.
